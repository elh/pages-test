Beneath the boughs where sun and shadow weave,  
<br>
A quiet dance, the leaves in breezes play,  
<br>
In whispered tones, the heart learns to believe,  
<br>
That time can pause, though fleeting is the day.  
<br>

<br>
The chestnut's roots, like secrets buried deep,  
<br>
Enfold the dreams of wanderers who've passed,  
<br>
Each whispered sigh, a promise meant to keep,  
<br>
In stillness held, where moments seem to last.  
<br>

<br>
The hourglass spills sand that slips away,  
<br>
Yet here, ensconced, the world outside feels far,  
<br>
As conversations linger, softly sway,  
<br>
While twilight's fingers trace the evening star.  
<br>

<br>
In nature's grip, love's gentle echoes flow,  
<br>
Beneath the chestnut tree, our spirits grow.
