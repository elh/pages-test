In morning's grace, the world awakens slow,  
<br>
With whispers soft, the dew upon the grass,  
<br>
A gentle breath that stirs the silent air,  
<br>
While shadows stretch and dance with fading night;  
<br>

<br>
The trees lift arms to greet the golden rays,  
<br>
Their leaves, a chorus rustling in the light,  
<br>
And in the heart of nature's vibrant hymn,  
<br>
We find our place, a note within the song.  
<br>

<br>
The brook, a silver thread through emerald fields,  
<br>
It sings of journeys taken by the stars,  
<br>
And carries tales of time, in rippling flows,  
<br>
Where stones have listened to the world’s heartbeat.  
<br>

<br>
But come the noon, when brilliance turns to blare,  
<br>
And time feels heavy, like the sun's embrace,  
<br>
We seek the shade beneath a willow's tears,  
<br>
To find ourselves in solace, intertwined.  
<br>

<br>
As twilight drapes the sky in shades of rose,  
<br>
The landscape melts in watercolors soft,  
<br>
With every breath, we share a fleeting worlds—  
<br>
A dance of shadows and of sunlight’s kiss.  
<br>

<br>
And as the stars rise slowly in their course,  
<br>
We look beyond the confines of the day—  
<br>
For in that dusky silence, dreams awake,  
<br>
To weave our hopes within the tapestry.
