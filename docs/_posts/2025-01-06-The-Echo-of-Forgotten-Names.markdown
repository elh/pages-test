In a room cluttered with echoes,  
<br>
dust motes dance in shafts of late afternoon light,  
<br>
where memories linger like shadows—  
<br>
photographs pinned to the walls of nostalgia,  
<br>
smiles frozen in the amber of an unturned page.  
<br>

<br>
The scent of old books wraps around me,  
<br>
a mélange of ink and possibility,  
<br>
swirling through the air like whispered secrets,  
<br>
stories of strangers once vibrant,  
<br>
yet now merely ghosts dressed in sepia tones.  
<br>

<br>
The clock ticks with defiant persistence,  
<br>
each sound a reminder of what once was—  
<br>
a symphony of laughter, arguments,  
<br>
gentle touches that have faded as soft as whispers.  
<br>
I trace the outlines of their faces with my fingers,  
<br>
chasing the warmth of who they used to be,  
<br>
each name rolling off my tongue like soft pebbles—  
<br>
Jacqueline, Thomas, Maria, Victor—  
<br>
each syllable a flicker,  
<br>
each pause a sigh.  
<br>

<br>
Outside, the world resumes its dance,  
<br>
cars zooming past in a haste I cannot fathom,  
<br>
as I am lost in a labyrinth of yesterdays,  
<br>
time folding like crumbling origami,  
<br>
each crease a story unspooled and frayed.  
<br>

<br>
In this sanctuary of solitude,  
<br>
I listen to the silence  
<br>
that speaks louder than any voice,  
<br>
the resonance of living long enough  
<br>
to see ghosts form,  
<br>
yet unable to forget them,  
<br>
for they are stitched into the fabric of my heart,  
<br>
their laughter mingling with my own,  
<br>
the eternal echo of forgotten names.
