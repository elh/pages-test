There once was a cat with a hat,  
<br>
Who fancied himself quite the brat,  
<br>
He strolled down the street,  
<br>
With a swaggering beat,  
<br>
And said, "Who's the coolest? Just that!"  
<br>

<br>
With shades on his nose and a grin,  
<br>
He'd wink at the ladies and spin,  
<br>
But the joke was on him,  
<br>
For when night did begin,  
<br>
His fedora was lost in the bin.  
<br>

<br>
Yet still, he would strut and he'd prance,  
<br>
Determined to give life a chance,  
<br>
For in heart, he believed,  
<br>
That with love achieved,  
<br>
A cat could still win every dance!
