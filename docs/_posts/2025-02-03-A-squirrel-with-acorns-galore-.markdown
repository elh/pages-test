Felt the weight of its bounty, no more.  
<br>
It tripped on a nut,  
<br>
And fell in a rut,  
<br>
Now it dreams of a feast at the shore.  
<br>

<br>
In the sand, there are treasures it seeks,  
<br>
Seashells, and snacks, not just peaks.  
<br>
With a wit and a grin,  
<br>
It dives right in,  
<br>
For adventure, our squirrel now speaks.
