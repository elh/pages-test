In golden light, the leaves prepare to fall,  
<br>
A whispered breeze will carry them away,  
<br>
As twilight paints the sky with crimson thrall,  
<br>
And daylight fades in soft, enchanting gray.  
<br>

<br>
The harvest moon, a lantern low and bright,  
<br>
Illuminates the fields where shadows creep,  
<br>
While chirping crickets serenade the night,  
<br>
And nature hums a lullaby to sleep.  
<br>

<br>
Yet in this beauty lies a hint of woe,  
<br>
For seasons change and time will swiftly pass,  
<br>
The vibrant hues must bow to winter's snow,  
<br>
Embracing silence, stillness like thick glass.  
<br>

<br>
So let us pause, in autumn’s warm embrace,  
<br>
To treasure fleeting time, this sacred space.
