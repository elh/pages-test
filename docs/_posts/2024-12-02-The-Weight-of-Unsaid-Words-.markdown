In the half-lit room where shadows collide,  
<br>
fingers trace the outline of a forgotten thought,  
<br>
a whisper lodged in the throat like a stubborn ember,  
<br>
waiting for the wind to carry it home.  
<br>

<br>
We dance on the edge of intention,  
<br>
carefully navigating the cracks in our dialogues;  
<br>
the awkward pauses, the glances that linger  
<br>
just a heartbeat too long,  
<br>
like ice melting in a forgotten glass.  
<br>

<br>
What we don’t say echoes louder than  
<br>
the clatter of dishes or the sigh of sirens,  
<br>
deafening in its absence,  
<br>
the meanings slipstreamed away,  
<br>
arguments left to freefall in silence.
<br>

<br>
You smile, but the truth curls at the corners,  
<br>
brittle as autumn leaves, longing for the touch  
<br>
of a reckless breeze to scatter them  
<br>
into the oblivion of our unvoiced fears.  
<br>

<br>
In a world crafted from pixels and glass,  
<br>
I want to weigh the moments—  
<br>
to stretch the tension on a threadbare line.  
<br>
But, we cloak ourselves in the armor of pleasantries,  
<br>
trading velvet for transparency,  
<br>
every grinning exchange a battle lost.  
<br>

<br>
Yet, even in this labyrinth of unsaid things,  
<br>
there’s beauty ripe for harvest;  
<br>
the courage to glance beyond the veil,  
<br>
to kneel in the delicate soil of vulnerability,  
<br>
and plant seeds of the heart in the echoes of our truths.  
<br>

<br>
So, let’s peel back the layers,  
<br>
unwrap our fears like gifts we never asked for,  
<br>
speak freely beneath the weight of it all,  
<br>
and let the unfiltered cadence of our laughter  
<br>
rise and tumble, unshackled, into the air.
