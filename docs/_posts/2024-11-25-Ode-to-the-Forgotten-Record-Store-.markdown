In the dim-lit corner, where shadows entwine,  
<br>
I wander through aisles of vinyl relics,  
<br>
Crates heavy with dust, each cover a shrine,  
<br>
Whispers of anthems, the past in its echoes.  
<br>

<br>
The smell of antiquity clings to the air,  
<br>
A swirling cocktail of longing and time,  
<br>
Each spin of the turntable, a memory laid bare,  
<br>
Melodies pulsating, transcending the rhyme.  
<br>

<br>
There’s magic in grooves scratched by eager fingers,  
<br>
Stories that linger in basslines and treble,  
<br>
Where vinyl dreams breath and history lingers,  
<br>
Each note—a heartbeat, a lover’s soft revel.  
<br>

<br>
Cacophony of genres, a colorful blend,  
<br>
Punk’s raw rebellion, a jazz lover’s sigh,  
<br>
From grunge to the disco, where histories mend,  
<br>
Fleeting moments caught in a note’s sweet goodbye.  
<br>

<br>
Yet, in the glow of a fading fluorescent light,  
<br>
Alone, I reflect on this world that’s unspooled,  
<br>
As the digital march steals the hours of night,  
<br>
And the spirit of music, perhaps, is now fooled.  
<br>

<br>
For the art of connection, so precious and rare,  
<br>
Still thrives in this sanctuary, murky and worn,  
<br>
A refuge where souls can unburden their care,  
<br>
In the heart of a world that no longer is sworn.  
<br>

<br>
Oh, mob of machines that demand our embrace,  
<br>
Know the power that lives in that paper-thin sleeve,  
<br>
For the pulse of the ages, a timeless grace,  
<br>
Resides in the record, in the grooves, we believe.  
<br>

<br>
So let me lose track of those moments in time,  
<br>
As I sift through the treasures that once were adored,  
<br>
In this haven of echoes, of rhythm, of rhyme,  
<br>
Here, I’m forever connected—my heart's true record store.
