In the dim basement of memory,  
<br>
where dust dances like ghosts,  
<br>
lie the pages of a story  
<br>
never told, shelved in silence,  
<br>
their ink faded, as if longing  
<br>
for the warm embrace of tomorrow.
<br>

<br>
A yellowed letter, creased like wilting leaves,  
<br>
speaks of dreams deferred—  
<br>
an ambition to weave vibrant tapestries  
<br>
out of mornings lined with coffee cups,  
<br>
where laughter spilled,  
<br>
and fears were just echoes in a hallway.
<br>

<br>
The clock ticked impatiently,  
<br>
a metronome on the edge of life,  
<br>
each tick a decision unmade,  
<br>
as if standing at the crossroads—  
<br>
a symphony of what-ifs swirling in the air,  
<br>
the faintest melody of potential left unheard.
<br>

<br>
Old photographs cling to the walls,  
<br>
captured smiles on the brink of fading,  
<br>
faces of lovers, friends, and fleeting moments,  
<br>
relishing their seconds,  
<br>
while shadows stretch, searching  
<br>
for the warmth that once lit the room.
<br>

<br>
And in the corner, a typewriter,  
<br>
keys rusted but defiant,  
<br>
waiting for a hand to grant it purpose,  
<br>
to compose the unsung ballad  
<br>
of mistakes and triumphs,  
<br>
ink staining fingers like a second life.
<br>

<br>
But the pages remain,  
<br>
a testament to the weight of pause—  
<br>
time twisting around them,  
<br>
each lingering whisper  
<br>
at midnight promising release,  
<br>
yet clutching tightly to the unseen.
<br>

<br>
Perhaps tomorrow,  
<br>
when the heart swells  
<br>
with audacity once more,  
<br>
I’ll hear the call of ink spooling,  
<br>
press down, and let the words unfold,  
<br>
breaking the silence with a narrative reborn.
